# Simple examples of using Bash
### I wrote three programs:
1. ##### f2c.sh - Convert fahrenheit temprature to celsius
2. ##### max_du - Show the largest 10 files in the directory, sorted from bigger to smaller files, and show their disk usage.
3. ##### sum.sh - Sum two numbers, and check if there total bigger/smaller/equal to 100.

------------

#### To run any code above:
1. ###### Clone the repository 
```
https://github.com/MohamedIgb/bash_examples.git
```

2. ###### In your terminal change directory to your local path
```
cd/"path"
```

3. ###### To run the code use "./" and change the name of the code you want
```
./f2c.sh
```
```
./max_du.sh
```
```
./sum.sh
```

------------

* If you got "permission denied" use change mode command and give execution  permission to the "file".
```
chmod u+x "file"
```
